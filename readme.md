# MindSculpt: Cognitive Architecture for AI Agents

MindSculpt is a sophisticated cognitive architecture system that enables AI agents to form, manage, and utilize memories while developing distinct personalities over time. It provides a robust framework for creating AI agents with persistent memory, emotional intelligence, and adaptive behavior patterns.

## üß† Core Concepts

### Memory Management
MindSculpt implements a unique approach to memory formation and management:
- **Dynamic Memory Formation**: Memories are automatically classified and stored based on importance and emotional impact
- **Contextual Linking**: Memories can be interconnected, forming a neural-like network of experiences
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Advanced filtering system determines which memories are relevant to current contexts
- **Emotional Weighting**: Each memory carries emotional weight and importance scores, influencing agent behavior
- **Time-Aware**: Memories maintain temporal relationships and can be accessed based on chronological relevance

### Classification Service
The heart of MindSculpt's intelligence lies in its ClassificationService:
- **Automated Analysis**: Analyzes interactions in real-time to determine:
  - Importance scores (0-1)
  - Emotional impact (-1 to 1)
  - Focus areas and interaction types
  - Contextual details and scene understanding
- **Memory Linking**: Suggests relevant memory connections based on context
- **Narrative Understanding**: Generates comprehensive observations about interactions
- **Adaptive Learning**: Adjusts classification parameters based on interaction patterns

### Personality Framework
MindSculpt comes with a sophisticated personality system:
- **Configurable Traits**: Core personality traits like empathy, humor, and curiosity
- **Value Systems**: Definable core values that guide agent behavior
- **Communication Patterns**: Customizable communication styles and tones
- **Persistence**: Personalities evolve and persist across sessions

## üåü Features

## üõ† Technical Architecture

MindSculpt is built in TypeScript and provides:
- Core memory management system
- Personality framework
- Classification services
- Persistence interfaces
- Event management system

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can install it directly from GitHub:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mindsculpt-ai/mindsculpt.git

# Install dependencies
cd mindsculpt
npm install

# Build the package
npm run build
```

Basic usage:

```typescript
// Basic Memory Management
import { MemoryManager, LocalStorageProvider } from 'mindsculpt-core';

// Initialize with storage provider
const storage = new LocalStorageProvider('my-agent');
const memoryManager = new MemoryManager(storage);

// Create and link memories
const memory1 = await memoryManager.createMemory({
  text: "User discussed their favorite books",
  importance: 0.7,
  emotion_score: 0.5,
  context: {
    focus_area: "interests",
    user_state: "engaged",
    scene_details: "Literary discussion"
  }
});

const memory2 = await memoryManager.createMemory({
  text: "User mentioned they write poetry",
  importance: 0.9,
  emotion_score: 0.8,
  context: {
    focus_area: "hobbies",
    user_state: "passionate",
    scene_details: "Creative discussion"
  }
});

// Link related memories
await memoryManager.linkMemories(memory1.id, memory2.id);

// Search memories
const relevantMemories = await memoryManager.searchMemories({
  importance_threshold: 0.6,
  focus_area: "interests"
});

// Personality Management
import { PersonalityManager } from 'mindsculpt-core';

const personality = await PersonalityManager.createDefault();

// Customize personality
await personality.updateTrait('empathy', 0.9);
await personality.addValue('creativity');
await personality.updateCommunicationStyle({
  style: "supportive",
  tone: "encouraging",
  patterns: ["asks open-ended questions", "provides constructive feedback"]
});

// Classification Example
import { ClassificationService, OpenAIProvider } from 'mindsculpt-core';

const llmProvider = new OpenAIProvider('your-api-key');
const classifier = new ClassificationService(llmProvider);

// Classify an interaction
const classification = await classifier.classifyMemory(
  "I love writing poetry, especially haikus about nature",
  "User shared their creative passion"
);

console.log(classification);
// Output:
// {
//   importance: 0.8,
//   emotion_score: 0.7,
//   focus_area: "creative_expression",
//   observation: "User shows enthusiasm for poetry writing...",
//   suggested_links: ["writing", "nature", "creativity"]
// }

// Complete Agent Setup
const agent = await PersonalityManager.createDefault();
const memory = await agent.createMemory({
  text: "User expressed interest in machine learning",
  importance: 0.9,
  emotion_score: 0.7,
  context: {
    focus_area: "technical_interests",
    user_state: "curious",
    scene_details: "Technical discussion about AI"
  }
});

// Search and use memories for context
const relevantTechnicalMemories = await memoryManager.searchMemories({
  query: "machine learning",
  importance_threshold: 0.7
});
```
